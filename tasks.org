* Tasks
** DONE Update ALU
- [X] Multibit NAND
- [X] NAND delay 2 ns
** DONE Finalize datapath.v
- [X] Fix compilation issues
- [X] Initial program test in ins_mem.v
** DONE Method to store assembly programs
- [X] Implement current test in "ins_mem.v.bak" and diff test.vcd
- [X] Check that gtkwave for autogenerated ins_mem.v (current) is correct
** TODO Additional functionality
- [X] Review 370 notes for how they implement branch (I think they branched to a relative PC, not a register!)
*** DONE ALU improvements
- [X] RCA overflow testbench (ovf flag is not stored in a register but it can be found for debugging purposes)
- [X] ALU equality testbench
*** DONE 11-bit instructions (to support branch)
- [X] Noteshelf page 17
- [X] Update instruction specs
- [X] Update mux_16_1_9b -> mux_16_1_11b
- [X] Update ins_mem
- [X] Update assembler (including "push" -> "move")
- [X] Update ins_dec
*** DONE Branch instruction
- [X] Update pc
- [X] Update oscillator period
- [X] Add alu_eq and alu_ovf as datapath outputs
- [X] Design (not implement) branch.tass to test branching in datapath
** TODO Update to 16-bit instructions for consistency
- [X] Update instruction specs (keep existing opcode positions)
- [X] Change mux_16_1_11b -> mux_16_1_16b
- [X] Update ins_dec
- [X] Update pc
- [X] Update ins_mem_header
- [X] Update assembler
- [X] Update datapath
- [X] Test program.tass
- [ ] Implement and test branch.tass (add/nand switching, see Noteshelf)
- [ ] Another .tass test which includes: branch backwards, branch not taken, negative numbers
* TODO README.md, with high-level picture of datapath inputs and outputs
