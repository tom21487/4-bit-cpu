* Tasks
** DONE Update ALU
- [X] Multibit NAND
- [X] NAND delay 2 ns
** DONE Finalize datapath.v
- [X] Fix compilation issues
- [X] Initial program test in ins_mem.v
** DONE Method to store assembly programs
- [X] Implement current test in "ins_mem.v.bak" and diff test.vcd
- [X] Check that gtkwave for autogenerated ins_mem.v (current) is correct
** TODO Additional functionality
- [X] Review 370 notes for how they implement branch (I think they branched to a relative PC, not a register!)
*** DONE ALU improvements
- [X] RCA overflow testbench (ovf flag is not stored in a register but it can be found for debugging purposes)
- [X] ALU equality testbench
*** 11-bit instructions (to support branch)
- [X] Noteshelf page 17
- [X] Update instruction specs
- [X] Update mux_16_1_9b -> mux_16_1_11b
- [X] Update ins_mem
- [X] Update assembler (including "push" -> "move")
- [ ] Update ins_dec | continue from comment "// CONTINUE FROM HERE"
*** Branch instruction
- [ ] pc.v testbench (90% done in noteshelf)
- [ ] Update oscillator period
*** TODO Update datapath for 11-bit instructions and branch instructions
